GUI Intentional Tests for Validation
The main purpose of the screen is to allow the user to make a selection using a variety of filters (numbered regions, named regions, and transport types). The logical sequence of user actions should test the interactivity of these elements, ensuring that selecting them leads to a predictable and meaningful change in the app's state, likely a visual indication of selection/filtering.

Test ID	Objective	Pre-conditions	User Actions (Steps)	Expected Result
TEST_01	Validate Single Area Selection by Number	Screen is open, no filter is currently active.	
1. Click on the 

Text with tag "1" and text "1" (bounds="[926,865][1138,1035]").

The element "1" should show a visual state change (e.g., highlighting, color change) to indicate it's selected. The other numbered areas should remain unselected.
TEST_02	Validate Single Area Selection by Colored Button	Screen is open, no filter is currently active.	
1. Click on the 

View with tag "View" corresponding to "3" (bounds="[637,1640][805,1780]").

The selected button ("3") should show a visual state change. The corresponding area "3" on the map might also be highlighted.
TEST_03	Validate Named Area Selection	Screen is open, no filter is currently active.	
1. Click on the 

View with tag "View" for "Alto Garda" (bounds="[531,1948][885,2116]").

The "Alto Garda" button should visually indicate selection. The corresponding area on the map should highlight if the map view is dynamic.
TEST_04	Validate Transport Mode Selection	Screen is open, no filter is currently active.	
1. Click on the 

View with tag "View" for "Funicular" (bounds="[608,2256][934,2424]").

The "Funicular" button should visually indicate selection.
TEST_05	Validate Exclusive Selection (if applicable)	
Screen is open, 

Area 1 (Text tag="1", bounds="[926,865][1138,1035]") is already selected.

1. Click on the 

Text with tag "4" and text "4" (bounds="[775,1106][987,1276]").

Area 4 should visually indicate selection. Area 1 should revert to an unselected state, confirming only one geographical area can be active at a time.
TEST_06	Validate "All" Transport Selection	
Screen is open, 

Railway mode is selected (View bounds="[298,2256][594,2424]").

1. Click on the 

View with tag "View" for "All" (bounds="[948,2256][1143,2424]").

The "All" button should visually indicate selection. The "Railway" button should revert to an unselected state. The filter on the map should reset to show all transport options.
