GUI Intentional Tests:

Here are some test cases designed to validate the core functionality of this screen. I'll structure them with: Test Case ID, Description, Steps, and Expected Result.  I'm assuming the application has standard Android behavior for saving, etc.

1. Create a New Note & Save:

Test Case ID: TC_NOTE_001
Description: Verify that a user can create a new note, enter content, and save it successfully.
Steps:
Tap on the "edit_title" TextField.
Enter a title (e.g., "Test Note 1").
Tap on the "edit_content" TextField.
Enter some content (e.g., "This is a test note.").
Tap on the "button_save" button ().
Expected Result: The application saves the note, and the user should be navigated back to a notes list or see confirmation of saving.
2. Undo/Redo Functionality:

Test Case ID: TC_NOTE_002
Description: Verify that undo/redo functionality works as expected.
Steps:
Create and save a note (following steps from TC_NOTE_001).
Modify the content of the saved note.
Tap on the "button_undo" button ().
Verify that the content reverts to its previous state.
Tap on the "button_redo" button ().
Verify that the content returns to the modified state.
Expected Result: The undo and redo buttons correctly revert and reapply changes to the note's content.
3. Markdown Formatting:

Test Case ID: TC_NOTE_003
Description: Verify markdown formatting functionality.
Steps:
Create a new note.
Enter some text using markdown syntax (e.g., # Heading, *italic*, **bold**).
Tap on the "button_markdown" button ().
Verify that the content is rendered correctly with the applied Markdown formatting.
Expected Result: The text should be displayed in a formatted manner, reflecting the markdown syntax used.
4. Timestamping:

Test Case ID: TC_NOTE_004
Description: Verify timestamp functionality.
Steps:
Create a new note.
Tap on the "button_timestamp" button ().
Verify that a current timestamp is added to the content of the note.
Expected Result: A timestamp should be visible in the note's content, reflecting the time of insertion.
5. Location Tagging:

Test Case ID: TC_NOTE_005
Description: Verify location tagging functionality.
Steps:
Create a new note.
Tap on the "button_locationstamp" button ().
Verify that the current location is added to the content of the note.
Expected Result: The note's content should include the user’s current geographical coordinates or a readable location description.
6. Text Expansion:

Test Case ID: TC_NOTE_006
Description: Verify text expansion functionality.
Steps:
Create a new note.
Enter some content in the "edit_content" TextField.
Tap on the "button_text_expand" button ().
Verify that the text is expanded to fill the available space.
Expected Result: The text should be displayed with a larger font size, filling the screen's available space.
7. Drawing Functionality:

Test Case ID: TC_NOTE_007
Description: Verify drawing functionality.
Steps:
Create a new note.
Tap on the "button_draw" button ().
Verify that the application opens a drawing interface, allowing the user to draw on the screen.
Expected Result: The app should open a drawing tool where users can create visual content within their notes.
Important Considerations:

These tests assume standard Android behavior for UI elements and saving mechanisms.
The specific implementation of features like location tagging might require additional permissions or API calls that need to be tested separately.
Error handling (e.g., what happens if the save fails, or there's no network connection) should also be included in a more comprehensive test suite.
I hope this detailed analysis and set of tests are helpful! Let me know if you would like any modifications or further elaboration on these scenarios.
