🎯 Primary Functional Objective of the Screen

This screen is for creating and editing a text note file (.txt).
The user can:

Enter or modify text in the content area.

Save the note.

Undo/redo changes.

Insert metadata (timestamps, dates, location).

Toggle formatting options (Markdown, styles).

Perform auxiliary actions (expand text, draw, etc.).

Essentially, it is a note editor with support for basic editing and metadata insertion.
