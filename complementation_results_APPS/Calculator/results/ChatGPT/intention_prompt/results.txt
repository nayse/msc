✅ GUI Intentional Test Scenarios
1. Basic Multiplication Test

Action Sequence:

Tap 7

Tap *

Tap 3

Tap =

Expected Result: Display shows 21.

2. Zero Multiplication

Action Sequence:

Tap 0

Tap *

Tap 8

Tap =

Expected Result: Display shows 0.

3. Multi-digit Input

Action Sequence:

Tap 1 → 2

Tap *

Tap 3 → 4

Tap =

Expected Result: Display shows 408 (12 * 34).

4. Backspace Functionality

Action Sequence:

Tap 9 → 8 → 7

Tap < (once)

Expected Result: Display shows 98.

5. Chain Calculation (if supported)

Action Sequence:

Tap 2

Tap *

Tap 5

Tap = (result 10)

Tap *

Tap 3

Tap =

Expected Result: Display shows 30.

6. Boundary Test (Large Numbers)

Action Sequence:

Input multiple digits (e.g., 99999)

Multiply by another large number (e.g., 99999)

Tap =

Expected Result: Display handles large result or shows an error if beyond limit.

👉 These intentional tests validate that the calculator screen fulfills its primary function: accepting numeric input, performing multiplication, handling corrections, and displaying results.

Do you want me to expand the test plan to cover all arithmetic operations (+, -, /) (assuming the app supports them), or should I keep it focused on multiplication as shown?
