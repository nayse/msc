GUI Intentional Tests & User Action Sequences:

Here are a few test cases, ranging in complexity, to validate this objective:

Test Case 1: Verify Empty State Message and "+" Button Functionality (Basic)

Objective: Confirm the user is presented with an empty state message and that the "+" button initiates card creation.
Steps:
Launch AnkiDroid and navigate to the screen displaying the empty collection state (as described above).
Verify that the text "Collection is empty" is visible on the screen.
Verify that the text "Start adding cards using the + icon." is visible on the screen.
Click/Tap the "+" button (Button(tag="fab_main")).
Expected Result: The application should transition to a screen allowing the user to create a new deck or add a card (this will depend on AnkiDroid's implementation).
Test Case 2: Verify Navigation After Card Creation (Medium)

Objective: Confirm that after creating a card/deck, the user is navigated back to a populated view.
Steps:
Perform steps 1-4 from Test Case 1.
Create a new deck or add a card through the resulting screen.
Expected Result: The application should navigate back to a screen displaying the user's created decks/cards, rather than remaining on the empty state screen.
Test Case 3: Verify Empty State Persistence (Complex)

Objective: Confirm that the empty state is correctly displayed after clearing all cards and decks.
Steps:
Create several decks and add cards to them within AnkiDroid.
Delete all created decks/cards using the application's functionality (e.g., a "delete all" option or deleting each deck individually).
Navigate back to the screen displaying the empty collection state.
Expected Result: The screen should display the "Collection is empty" message and the associated instructions, confirming that the application correctly detects an empty collection.
Test Case 4: Verify Accessibility (Important)

Objective: Confirm that the screen is accessible to users with disabilities.
Steps:
Use a screen reader (e.g., TalkBack on Android) to navigate the screen.
Verify that the screen reader announces the "Collection is empty" message and instructions clearly.
Verify that the "+" button is properly labeled or described for accessibility purposes.
Expected Result: The screen should be navigable and understandable by users relying on assistive technologies.
