## Critical User Journey Validation
**Overall Flow:** Empty State → Add Content → Productive Use

The primary success metric is whether a new user can successfully understand they need to add content and can easily find and use the FAB button to begin creating their first flashcard deck. The empty state should feel welcoming and actionable rather than confusing or abandoned.
