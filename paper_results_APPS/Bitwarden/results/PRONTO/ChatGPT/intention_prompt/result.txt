🧪 GUI Intentional Tests for Login Screen
Below are intentional UI test cases that simulate user interactions and validate the functionality, layout, and flow of the login screen.

Test Case 1: Email Field Empty
Action: Tap "Continue" without entering any email.

Expected Result: "Continue" button remains disabled; possibly shows a tooltip or error message.

Purpose: Validate that the app prevents progression without an email input.

Test Case 2: Valid Email Input
Action:

Enter a valid email: user@example.com

Observe the "Continue" button

Expected Result: "Continue" button becomes enabled.

Purpose: Ensure that valid input enables login progression.

Test Case 3: Toggle ‘Remember email’ ON
Action:

Toggle the “Remember email” switch to ON.

Enter email: user@example.com

Press "Continue".

Reopen the app.

Expected Result: The email field is pre-filled with user@example.com.

Purpose: Validate the persistence of the remembered email across sessions.

Test Case 4: Toggle ‘Remember email’ OFF
Action:

Toggle the “Remember email” switch to OFF.

Enter email and tap "Continue".

Reopen the app.

Expected Result: Email field is empty.

Purpose: Confirm that email is not saved when toggle is OFF.

Test Case 5: Change Server Region
Action:

Tap on the dropdown (bitwarden.com)

Select an alternative server (e.g., self-hosted or another region, if available).

Expected Result: Selected server is updated and shown in the field.

Purpose: Validate region/server selector functionality.

Test Case 6: Navigate to Create Account
Action: Tap on the "Create an account" link.

Expected Result: Navigation to the account creation screen.

Purpose: Ensure access to account registration flow.

Test Case 7: Input Invalid Email Format

Enter user@invalid or user@.com

Observe the "Continue" button state.
