2. GUI Intentional Test Cases:

Here's a sequence of tests designed to validate the core functionality of this camera screen, along with actions and expected results:

Test Suite: Camera Functionality Validation

Test 1: Basic Photo Capture & Storage

Action Sequence:
Verify preview is displaying live video feed.
Tap the take_photo button.
Wait for a brief moment (to allow capture).
Navigate to the device's gallery/photos app.
Expected Result: A new image should be present in the gallery, confirming successful photo capture and storage.
Test 2: Camera Switching

Action Sequence:
Verify preview is displaying live video feed.
Tap the switch_camera button.
Observe the preview area.
Expected Result: The camera should switch to the opposite direction (e.g., from rear to front), and the preview should reflect this change.
Test 3: Video Recording & Playback

Action Sequence:
Verify preview is displaying live video feed.
Tap the switch_video button (if available, otherwise assume a long press on take photo starts recording).
Allow the app to record for at least 5 seconds.
Stop the recording.
Navigate to the device's gallery/videos app.
Expected Result: A new video file should be present in the gallery, confirming successful video capture and storage.
Test 4: Zoom Functionality

Action Sequence:
Verify preview is displaying live video feed.
Drag the zoom_seekbar.
Observe the preview area.
Expected Result: The image in the preview should zoom in or out based on the position of the slider.
Test 5: Exposure Settings (If Applicable)

Action Sequence:
Verify exposure_lock and exposure buttons are present.
Tap the exposure_lock button.
Observe if the exposure settings change or become locked.
Tap the exposure button to adjust the exposure.
Expected Result: The exposure should be adjusted, and the image in the preview area should reflect the changes.
Test 6: Settings Access

Action Sequence:
Tap the settings button.
Expected Result: A settings menu or screen should open, allowing access to app configurations (resolution, quality, etc.).
Important Considerations for Testing:

Permissions: Ensure the application has necessary permissions (camera, storage) granted before running these tests.
Device Variations: Test on different devices and Android versions to account for potential inconsistencies.
Edge Cases: Consider edge cases like low light conditions, fast camera switching, and recording in various resolutions.
Error Handling: Verify how the app handles errors (e.g., insufficient storage space).
