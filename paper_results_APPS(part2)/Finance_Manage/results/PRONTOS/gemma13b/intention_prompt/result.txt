2. GUI Intentional Tests & Action Sequences:

Here are several test cases designed to validate the core functionality, covering both positive and negative scenarios:

Test Case 1: Successful Transaction Creation (Expense)

Objective: Verify that a user can successfully create an expense transaction with all required fields populated.
Steps:
Click on "Enter title" TextField and enter a valid title (e.g., "Grocery Shopping").
Select the "Expense" radio button.
Click on "Enter amount" TextField and enter a numerical value (e.g., 50.00).
Verify that the date is displayed as "2025-06-03". If editable, verify it's correct or change to another valid date.
Click on "Main Account" spinner and select a different account (if available).
Click on "none" category spinner and select a different category (if available).
Click the "SUBMIT" button.
Expected Result: A success message or navigation to a screen displaying the newly created expense transaction.
Test Case 2: Successful Transaction Creation (Income)

Objective: Verify that a user can successfully create an income transaction with all required fields populated.
Steps: Similar to Test Case 1, but select "Income" radio button instead of "Expense".
Expected Result: A success message or navigation to a screen displaying the newly created income transaction.
Test Case 3:  Missing Required Field (Title)

Objective: Verify that the application handles missing required fields correctly and provides appropriate feedback.
Steps:
Leave "Enter title" TextField empty.
Select "Expense" radio button.
Click on "Enter amount" TextField and enter a numerical value (e.g., 50.00).
Click the "SUBMIT" button.
Expected Result: An error message indicating that the title field is required, preventing submission.
Test Case 4: Invalid Amount Format

Objective: Verify that the application handles invalid amount formats correctly.
Steps:
Click on "Enter amount" TextField and enter a non-numerical value (e.g., "abc").
Click the "SUBMIT" button.
Expected Result: An error message indicating that the amount must be a valid number, preventing submission.
Test Case 5: Cancel Operation

Objective: Verify that the user can cancel the transaction creation process without saving any changes.
Steps:
Populate some fields (e.g., title and amount).
Click on "CANCEL" button.
Expected Result: The dialog should close, and no new transaction should be saved.
Test Case 6: Account/Category Selection

Objective: Verify that the user can add a new account or category if needed.
Steps:
Click on "Main Account" spinner.
Click on "+" button to add an account.
Enter details for a new account and save it.
Repeat steps 1-3 for the Category selection.
